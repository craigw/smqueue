= smqueue

by Sean O'Halpin

http://github.com/seanohalpin/smqueue

version 0.3.0

== DESCRIPTION

Implements a simple protocol for using message queues, with adapters
for ActiveMQ, Spread and stdio (for testing).

This is a bare-bones release to share with my colleagues - apologies
for the lack of documentation and tests.

== FEATURES

* simple to use
* designed primarily for pipeline processing
* compatible with Rails
* comes with a modified stomp.rb library (rstomp.rb)

== BUGS

* let me know!

== SYNOPSIS

  require 'smqueue'
  config = YAML::load(File.read('config.yml'))
  input_queue = SMQueue(config[:input])
  output_queue = SMQueue(config[:output])
  input_queue.get do |msg|
     # do something with msg
     new_msg = msg.body
     output_queue.put new_msg
  end

=== Configuration

The easiest way to configure SMQueue is to use YAML files. An example
can be found in ./examples/config/example_config.yml.

To find out the complete set of options each adapter supports, for now
you'll have to read the source in ./lib/smqueue/adapters/*.rb.

== REQUIREMENTS

* depends on doodle >= 0.1.9
* you need access to an ActiveMQ message broker or Spread publisher
* development uses bones gem

== INSTALL

For runtime:

  sudo gem install doodle smqueue

For development:

  sudo gem install bones
