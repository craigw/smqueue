title: separate protocol from transport level
desc: "There are two reasons for considering this: one is to re-use transport layers for different protocols and vice versa and the other is to manage error handling better.\n\n\
  For example, STOMP is a protocol, tcp/ip is a transport. You could do STOMP via the filesystem or by HTTP, SMTP, etc. or by pigeon post. At the moment, the STOMP adapter conflates protocol and transport. Ideally, you\xE2\x80\x99d have a protocol handler that didn\xE2\x80\x99t know anything about the actual transport and a transport layer that knew nothing and could care less about the protocol layer.\n\
  Note that STOMP over HTTP is an example of one protocol being implemented in terms of another protocol being used as a transport layer."
